To be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end
the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation
devoutly to be wished to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there's the rub
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
must give us pause there's the respect that makes calamity of so long life
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death out out brief candle life's but a walking shadow
A poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot
Full of sound and fury signifying nothing
